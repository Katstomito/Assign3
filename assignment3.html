    <h5 style = "font-size:30px;"><b>A smart home</b></h5>
    
    <ul>
        <li style = 'font-size:15px'>The smart home has been the trend of the world for the past 10 years and it is constantly evolving with constantly updated and added technologies. Artificial intelligence is a technology that is gradually gaining popularity worldwide. It appears in almost all areas of life such as medicine, transportation, and smart home developers have also applied intelligence. artificial. artificial to bring a home that truly adapts to the needs of the user. We will develop the virtual assistant IRIS to control the devices in the house and give suggestions to the homeowner. This is a smart virtual assistant because based on the data collected from sensors around the house, IRIS can adjust the temperature in the house to provide the most comfortable and ideal living space. Our system can interact with hardware devices of other technology companies such as Philips smart lighting system and Xiaomi's cleaning robots. Thanks to the quick compatibility and fast installation time, most families can use IRIS for life to create a comfortable living space.</li>
    
        <li style = 'font-size:15px'>IRIS is an intelligent virtual assistant integrated with artificial intelligence developed entirely by Vietnamese, so we can use natural Vietnamese to communicate and make desired requests for IRIS to implement. presently. Children and the elderly can completely use IRIS easily without taking too much time to get used to it. Because it is researched and developed by Vietnamese people with the desire to bring a most relaxing and comfortable life, the IRIS system will be put into commercial use at an attractive price and easily accessible to many customers.</li>
        
    </ul>


    <h5 style="font-size:30px"><b>Motivation</b></h5>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://vietnamnet.vn/nha-thong-minh-tai-viet-nam-ngay-cang-re-i5013301.html">From the Vietnamnet.net link!</a></li>

    <ul>

    <ul>
        <li style = 'font-size:15px'>Artificial intelligence is creating a technological revolution all over the world and they are applied in almost all fields such as Education, Health. We think that artificial intelligence should be applied to daily tasks to optimize people's lives and bring about a more comfortable and happy life. Smart washers and dryers equipped with AI can detect wet clothes and adjust the optimal washing process, users just enjoy life. Smart homes are developing rapidly in Vietnam and around the world. Vietnamese people only need to spend about 25 million to own smart features in their own homes (Vietnam net 2023) Therefore, this is really a potential market for smart home products to compete with other smart home products. Exclusive features at a very reasonable price. Smart homes will develop very strongly in Vietnam in the next 3 years and the number is estimated to be around 6 million families by 2027 (Vietnam net 2023). This is really a potential market to develop in the near future and catch up with the world's trends because most fields in the world have started to apply artificial intelligence, and typically medicine has applied it. used to fight Cancer (VTV News 2023). Therefore, smart homes with artificial intelligence should be invested in and developed strongly in the next 5 years.</li>
        <li style = 'font-size:20px'><b>Landscape</b></li>
            <dd>Smart homes are becoming a standard of modern homes all over the world and high-end apartments in Vietnam have gradually equipped and installed these devices. Today's smart home technologies are provided by a variety of companies from within the country and internationally. Smart homes are one of the rare industries in the field of technology where Vietnam is more dominant than developed countries such as Europe and the US. With the advantage of understanding the culture, national identity as well as the habits, lifestyle and habits of Vietnamese users, highly competitive prices from famous brands combined with technical support staff. On-site deployment technology, so smart home solutions in Vietnam are always preferred by domestic users. ACIS smart home is one of the earliest smart home systems launched in 2012. ACIS smart home technology is equipped with a modern anti-theft system through sensors installed at the doors and Windows. Not only that, the intelligent thermodynamic control system also allows us to adjust the air conditioner temperature appropriately to different objects and based on the weather. Not only ACIS, LUMI is also the smart home system with the highest market share in Vietnam and is trusted by many different customers. However, most of today's smart home technologies do not have a virtual assistant to control all devices in the home so IRIS will be a technology that disrupts the current smart home market and brings a different experience for customers</dd>
    
    </ul>

    <h5 style="font-size:30px"><b>Aims</b></h5>
    <p style='font-size:15px'>Our goal is to make people feel relaxed and comfortable at most and everything in the house would be easier and lighter to do. People also feel more protected in the house. We aim to make the owner who owns the house feel relieved and less stressed after a hard-working day in the office. The house would be cheap so everyone could afford and have the smart house they want. We aim to increase the popularity of people using our house to improve the efficiency of work, lifestyle, and education. Before we can reach those goals, we need to achieve some minor goals to make sure that we do not lose track. Setting up an IRIS System is going to be the first major task to deal with as we will finish the main wireless connection to connect with the furniture. The electricity system as well as the connection between AI and the furniture will be the next thing to be finished. As we aim to make a strong and durable connection for the customer, the connection will be well-equipped. Based on the IRIS System, we will install and program multiple robots with many types depending on the owner`s choice to satisfy our customers. Our final goal is to make the world cleaner as we use a lot of solar panels which will be the main source of electricity in the house. By doing this, we will decrease the bill for the owner and help the environment more.</p>

    <h5 style="font-size:30"><b>Plans and Progress</b></h5>
    <p style="font-size:15">To start the project, our group is going to have a meeting with the house owners to discuss the design, the information about the IRIS System, … This is going to take a long time as we want to make sure the owner knows every necessary information about the machine, tools, furniture, system, and our warranty, . . . After that, we are going to have an architect to draw the house design depending on the owner choices. Meanwhile, our software Engineers are gathering to make sure the IRIS System works normally. Our group then start recording the owner’s voices and gestures. Then our group is going to buy all the necessary facilities, hardware, electricity lines, and furniture … for setting up the smart house. After that, some App Developers are going to create a private app for the owner to use in the house. A group of workers and an IT Man is going to work together to build multiple robots and solar panels. After finishing, the owner can start moving into the house. In our plan, the important thing we need to focus on the most is setting up the IRIS System as it is going to be the main connection which will connect to all the furniture in the house. If IRIS System has trouble in it, we need to take a lot of time and money to see and fix the errors inside it. Because of the errors in the IRIS System, the owner move into the house longer than expected. Under any circumstance, the errors in IRIS System need to quickly be vanished.</p>
        
        <h5 style="font-size:30px"><b>Roles</b></h5>
    <p style='font-size:15px'>In our group, the roles are changed over and over depending on the process. We are going to hire an architect to draw the house depending on the owner's choice. Software Engineers are needed to make sure the IRIS System works smoothly. Our group is going to record the owners’ voices and gestures to put in the IRIS System. Our group is going to hire App Developers to create an app for the owner to use in the house. We are going to buy the latest technology, including hardware, for setting up the IRIS System. The mechanics will design robots that fit the owner's decisions and put solar panels on the roof. Finally, workers will be hired, under the construction of IT Man to start building the house and owners will move in after finishing. </p>

    
    <h5 style="font-size:30px"><b>Testing</b></h5>
    <p style="font-size: 15px">This is a big project for us and the testing step will be an important process to determine the success of the project. We will rent a 2 bedroom apartment and install our smart home devices to test them to see if they work flexibly and smoothly with each other. Not only our team members, but we will also invite consumers who have used smart homes of other brands in the market to experience and help us have a more objective assessment of the products. problems they face when using our smart home technology. We will need 1000 people to try out the IRIS technology because we know this is a new technology in the market and very few people are actually interacting and using it. We will register booths at technology fairs taking place in Vietnam to introduce IRIS and receive registrations for users who want to experience this new technology. After everyone has experienced the IRIS smart home technology, we will collect their comments to suggest the areas that need to be improved on our project. Experiencers will be staying in a fully furnished 2-bedroom apartment with our smart home system. We need the opinions of many different ages to get the most accurate survey to upgrade and improve to get the most complete version.</p>
    
    <h5 style="font-size:30px"><b>Tools and Technologies</b></h5>
    <p style="font-size:15px">The IRIS System is going to be the first major thing to deal with. We are going to use mainly Python and C++ to create the system, and SQL to store a huge amount of information about the owner including the voice and gestures. After that, we start using another programming platform to develop the system. After collecting the necessary data, we save it in the hardware devices. For the hardware, we are going to create special chips to support the main storage. The storage is going to have big memory to install a huge information, so we are going to plan with the Developer to come up with efficient RAM for our smart house. The system is going to connect with all the furniture in the house so each piece of furniture will have a chip to connect to the IRIS System. The owner can interact with the furniture just through voices and gestures easily. The next thing is the robots, the robots are going to be in the IRIS System so the owner can control the robots to do the job that the owner demands. The special thing about this robot is you can decide the robot`s outfits. Everything in the house is going to be run easily just by using the </p>
    
    <h5 style="font-size:30px"><b>Risk</b></h5>
    <p style="font-size:15px">Safety is the first way that our project might harm people. There is a chance that AI robot units, which are still in development, could malfunction and hurt people. For instance, a robot AI unit could set off an explosion that endangers the lives of anyone inside the home.  Second, employment is mentioned in our risk assessment because AI robot units may replace human labor, resulting in job loss and hard times financially. For instance, AI robot units could be employed to perform tasks currently carried out by humans, such as cleaning homes, preparing meals, and delivering items. The bias issue is last but not least addressed by the fact that AI robot units are educated using data gathered from the real world. This information may be biased, and the behavior of the AI robot unit may reflect this bias. An AI robot unit, for instance, may be more likely to discriminate against persons of color if it has been taught using data from a predominately white community.</p>

    <h5 style="font-size:30px"><b>Group processes and communications</b></h5>
    <p style="font-size:15px">This was a difficult project for us as it was the first time we had to work as a team in a long time so communication between team members was really important for us to stay on task and track progress. The geographical distance is really difficult for us to see each other often. In addition to meeting in class, we meet in person once a week at school or a quiet coffee shop to present what we have accomplished and what tasks have been completed and divide the work among the members. in the next week. We use Trello to divide the work between members and everyone in the team can see the work of other members. In the process of working, if anyone has any difficulties, they will message other members by Team. Other members have to read the problems that the member is facing and offer different solutions through personal opinions. If there are big problems, we will use the team to quickly exchange those problems to solve them as quickly as possible. Every day, we regularly update the progress of the work completed that week so that other members can follow. If a member of the group loses contact or does not respond to messages, we will have to make plans in case the worst happens. Everyone will have to divide the unfinished work of that member to keep the project on schedule. We will try to communicate by different methods such as social media or phone numbers, but the first priority should be to complete the project on schedule.</p>


    <h5 style="font-size:30px"><b></b>Skills and Jobs</h5>
    <p style="font-size:15px">Our team's project is built on a variety of information technology abilities, as well as the capacity to build models and other things. Following a discussion, our team's leader assigned each team member an individual duty; Khang will be in charge of managing his work as a software developer. He will be in charge of creating the software that powers the project and writing the codes that are required. He should be experienced in software development tools and technologies, as well as programming languages like Python, Java, or C++. Khang should have experience working on challenging software projects and be familiar with software design patterns. Hung was given the task of training to become a data scientist; he will be in charge of examining the data produced by your project and gathering insights that can be applied to enhance its performance. Hung needs to have a strong foundation in statistics and machine learning, as well as practical knowledge of handling huge datasets. They should also be knowledgeable about the methods and technologies used for data visualization. Quan was then assigned the duty of developing the user interface and the user experience of your project because he was regarded as trustworthy by everyone in the group. He is required to be knowledgeable in user-centered design concepts and has worked with tools like Adobe XD or Sketch. Quan should have the opportunity to become familiar with front-end programming languages including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Last but not least, Khiem (also known as the group leader) will assume the role of a project manager, his job is to coordinate all activities of team members in the group and make sure the project stays on schedule. Along with having experience managing software development projects and being accustomed to project management tools and processes like Agile or Scrum, he should also possess great organizational and communication abilities.</p>


    <h5 style="font-size:30px"><b>Group Reflection</b></h5>
    <p style="font-size:15px">We participated in and were assigned a team project as part of our AI training that was dedicated to developing a robotic unit that can operate indoor systems when given instructions from users, notably humans. In our team's opinion, we are generally rather effective, but there are certainly some areas where we can do better. Being on time and having the ability to work cooperatively are two of the things we accomplish successfully and on schedule throughout the entire project. We were able to make use of the diverse backgrounds and strengths of our teammates. To guarantee that our components operate effortlessly together, we divide the task evenly and according to each person's strengths, as well as assist one another and complete it successfully. In addition, we kept open channels for communication throughout the project, which allowed us to cope with issues as they emerged. On top of that, there were some parts of the project that we could have improved. For instance, we could have done a better job of organizing the aims and objectives for each team member. We all had different duties to complete, yet despite this, we should have been more specific in stating what we were attempting to find and accomplish. In light of this goal, it was difficult at times to determine whether or not we were developing. One thing that surprised me was how fast and how many tasks we were able to accomplish. The project was assigned to us within 4 weeks, and we just took like a day total (24 hours) to complete the whole project. Due to the project’s complexity and the fact that it was completed in less time than expected, we were surprised by the outstanding quality of the final product. In conclusion, the value of delegation and trust is one of the mutual lessons that we learned about teamwork. For our project, we had to have faith that each member of the group would accomplish their allocated assignment. It was crucial to assign jobs to those who had the appropriate skills and expertise. We were able to work well and finish the task on time by having faith in one another and accurately allocating work.</p>
